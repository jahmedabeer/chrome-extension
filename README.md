# This is a Chrome extension.

Building a Chrome extension uses the same core technologies that power the web. Here's a simple breakdown:

*   **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** This is the skeleton. It's used to structure the different parts of your extension, like the popup that appears when you click the extension's icon.
*   **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** This is for styling. It makes the extension look goodâ€”defining colors, fonts, and layout.
*   **JavaScript:** This is the brain. It handles all the logic, from what happens when you click a button to interacting with the web pages you visit.

## What do you need to know to build this?

Beyond these, there are a few special concepts specific to Chrome extensions:

*   **`manifest.json`:** Think of this as the extension's passport. It's a file that tells Chrome important information about your extension, like its name, version, and what permissions it needs to run.
*   **`Background Scripts`:** These are the behind-the-scenes workers. They handle long-term tasks and react to browser events, even when you don't have the extension's popup open.
*   **`Content Scripts`:** These are your extension's way of interacting directly with the web pages you're browsing. They can read or change things on the page.
*   **`Popup`:** The small window that shows up when you click the extension's icon in the browser toolbar. It's your extension's main user interface.

With a good grasp of these, you can create very powerful and useful extensions!
